# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

10xCards — an AI-assisted spaced-repetition flashcard app (paste text → LLM-generated flashcard proposals → accept/edit/reject → spaced-repetition review). Auth (email/password via Supabase), manual + AI-assisted flashcard management, and FSRS-based review sessions (`ts-fsrs`) are implemented. Full scope: `context/foundation/prd.md`.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — start dev server (Cloudflare workerd runtime)
- `npm run build` — production build (SSR via `@astrojs/cloudflare`)
- `npm run preview` — preview production build
- `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix` — ESLint with type-checked rules
- `npm run format` — Prettier (prettier-plugin-astro + prettier-plugin-tailwindcss)
- `npm run test` — Vitest, scoped to the framework-free modules under `src/lib/`: FSRS scheduling (`src/lib/fsrs/`) plus the AI-generation parse/validation unit tests (`src/lib/services/`, `src/lib/schemas/`); no Astro/React component test integration is configured

Pre-commit hooks (husky + lint-staged) run `eslint --fix` on `*.{ts,tsx,astro}` and `prettier --write` on `*.{json,css,md}`.

## Architecture

Astro 6 SSR app (`output: "server"` in `astro.config.mjs`) with React 19 islands, Tailwind 4, Supabase auth, and shadcn/ui, deployed to Cloudflare Workers via `@astrojs/cloudflare`. All pages and API routes render server-side by default; opt a specific page into static prerendering with `export const prerender = true` if ever needed.

### Auth flow

- `src/lib/supabase.ts` — creates a Supabase SSR client (`@supabase/ssr`, cookie-based sessions) from `astro:env/server` vars `SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_KEY`; returns `null` if either is unset, so callers must handle a missing client.
- `src/middleware.ts` — runs on every request, resolves the user into `context.locals.user`, and redirects unauthenticated requests away from routes listed in `PROTECTED_ROUTES`.
- API endpoints: `src/pages/api/auth/{signin,signup,signout}.ts`. Auth pages: `src/pages/auth/{signin,signup,confirm-email}.astro`. Protected-page example: `src/pages/dashboard.astro`.

### Conventions

- Path alias `@/*` → `./src/*`.
- Astro components for static content/layout; React only where interactivity is needed. Extract hooks to `src/components/hooks/`.
- Merge Tailwind classes with `cn()` from `@/lib/utils` (clsx + tailwind-merge) — don't concatenate class strings manually.
- shadcn/ui components live in `src/components/ui/` ("new-york" style); add new ones with `npx shadcn@latest add [name]`.
- Validate API route input with zod (not yet a dependency — add it when the first route needs body validation).
- Supabase migrations go in `supabase/migrations/` (create via `npx supabase migration new <name>`); enable RLS with granular per-operation, per-role policies on every new table.
- Services/business logic go in `src/lib/` (or `src/lib/services/`); shared types (entities, DTOs) go in `src/types.ts`.

### Environment

- Node v22.14.0 (`.nvmrc`).
- `SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_KEY`: copy `.env.example` to `.env` (Node) or `.dev.vars` (Cloudflare local dev, gitignored).
- Local Supabase: `npx supabase start` (requires Docker). No migrations exist yet — only Supabase Auth's built-in `auth.users` table is used.
- Deploy: `npx wrangler deploy`.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs lint + build on push/PR — but its branch triggers are still `master` while the repo's default branch is `main`, so CI currently won't fire on pushes to `main`. Requires `SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_KEY` repo secrets for the build step.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 3, Lesson 4 (E2E Tests)

**For E2E tests, use the `/10x-e2e` skill.** It is the single source of truth
for the workflow — risk → seed test + rules → generate → review against the five
anti-patterns → re-prompt → verify. The skill's `references/` carry the full
rules, anti-patterns, seed pattern, and prompt-template.

A few hard rules that hold even before you invoke the skill:

- **Locators:** `getByRole` / `getByLabel` / `getByText` first; `getByTestId`
  only when accessibility attributes are ambiguous. Never CSS selectors, XPath,
  or DOM structure.
- **Never `page.waitForTimeout()`.** Wait for state: `toBeVisible()`,
  `waitForURL()`, `waitForResponse()`.
- **Test independence + cleanup.** Each test runs standalone — its own setup,
  action, assertion, and cleanup; unique ids (timestamp suffix) so parallel runs
  and re-runs don't collide.

Two boundaries to keep straight:

- **DOM (snapshot) is the default.** Vision (`--caps=vision`) is a supplement for
  visual-only risks (layout, z-index, animation); for pixel regression prefer
  deterministic tools (`toMatchSnapshot`, Argos, Lost Pixel). VLM model
  selection/cost is a debugging topic (Lesson 5), not testing.
- **Healer helps on selectors, harms on logic.** A changed selector → healer
  re-finds it (route through PR review). A changed business behavior → healer
  masks the bug; that failing-test-to-fix case is Lesson 5.
